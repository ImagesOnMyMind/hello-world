# hello-world
Following the Github tutorial, making a first repository seems like a good place to start!
I'm an operational HR professional, humanitarian and an enthousiastic photographer and sports climber.
Currently I'm follwing the course Data Science: Foundations using R by Johns Hopkins on Coursera, which brought me to Git & Github.
My aim with the course is to start using basic data analysis in my work in HR.
